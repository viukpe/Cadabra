# Order History Functionality - AWS Data Pipeline

![ScreenShot](/assets/images/01.png)

This implementation is a data pipeline to store and retrieve order history data using AWS services - EC2, Kinesis, Lambda, and DynamoDB. \
\
**Description:** This implementation simulates  and demonstrates real-time storing and retrieving of data, for an external producer of data such as a phone.

**Use Case:** Placing an order on the Amazon app and instantly viewing the order in the app's "Past Orders" section, along with comprehensive order history.

## Steps in the Data Pipeline

### 1. Data Collection using EC2

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) instance was used to simulate live data being generated. The `OnlineRetail.csv` in combination with `LogGenerator.py` were loaded on the instance, and python file was used to generate order records on command.


### 2. Data Ingestion with Kinesis

Amazon Kinesis was used to ingest and process the real-time streaming data generated by the EC2 instances. A kinesis agent had to be configured and set in the EC2 instance. The job of the agent is to monitor the logs generated from the python file and sends the data to the corresponding Kinesis Data Streams for ingestion. 

### 3. Data Transformation with Lambda

AWS Lambda functions were employed to perform data transformation on the streaming data received from Kinesis and served as a handler to put the data in a pre-configured DynamoDB table. 

### 4. Data Storage in DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a NoSQL database service and it was used to store the processed order history data. DynamoDB offers seamless scalability and low-latency performance, making it suitable for applications that require fast and reliable data retrieval.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up and running this data pipeline, ensure that you have:

- AWS account credentials with appropriate permissions to create and manage EC2 instances, Kinesis data streams, Lambda functions, and DynamoDB tables.

- Familiarity with AWS management console and AWS CLI for deployment and configuration.
