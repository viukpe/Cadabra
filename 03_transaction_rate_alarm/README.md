# Transaction Rate Alarm System

![ScreenShot](/assets/images/03.png)

This project focuses on setting up a transaction rate alarm system using AWS services to monitor transaction rates and trigger alerts when certain thresholds are exceeded.

## Steps in the Implementation

### 1. Data Collection

The system collects transaction data from a data source, such as a database or an external API. The data should include relevant information about each transaction, such as transaction time and type.

### 2. Data Storage

The collected transaction data is stored in a suitable data storage service like Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service). The choice of storage depends on the nature and volume of the data.

### 3. Data Processing with Lambda

AWS Lambda functions are utilized to process the incoming transaction data. The Lambda functions can aggregate, filter, or transform the data to extract the necessary information for calculating transaction rates.

### 4. Transaction Rate Calculation

Using the processed data, the system calculates the transaction rate based on a defined time window (e.g., per minute, per hour). The transaction rate is the number of transactions that occur within the specified time frame.

### 5. Alarm Trigger

The system sets up an alarm using Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the calculated transaction rate. When the transaction rate exceeds a predefined threshold, the alarm is triggered.

### 6. Alarm Actions

Upon triggering the alarm, predefined actions are executed. These actions can include sending notifications via Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) to alert relevant stakeholders about the high transaction rate. Additionally, the alarm can trigger an automatic response, such as scaling resources or stopping certain processes to manage the situation.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up and running this implementation, ensure that you have:

- AWS account credentials with appropriate permissions to create and manage Lambda functions, CloudWatch alarms, and other required services.

- Understanding of AWS Lambda and CloudWatch services and their integration with other AWS services.
