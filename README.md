Welcome to the Cadabra big data system project! This repository contains a collection of AWS cloud documentation that showcase the comprehensive implementations in Cadabra's system, Cadabra is an e-commerce clothing store. These architectures has been carefully designed and built as part of my preparation for the AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty Examination on 19th August 2023, following the excellent guidance provided by Stephan Maarek's preparation course on Udemy.

## Project Overview

The Cadabra Big Data System Project consists of a five-part implementation, each focusing on crucial aspects of Cadabra's Architecture. The primary objectives of these implementations are as follows:

1. **Order History Functionality:** Implementing data pipelines to capture and analyze order history data using AWS Kinesis, Lambda, and DynamoDB.

2. **Product Recommendations:** Building recommendation systems using AWS Kinesis Analytics and AWS Lambda to provide personalized product recommendations based on user behavior.

3. **Transaction Rate Alarm:** Setting up alarms and notifications for detecting unusual transaction rates using AWS CloudWatch and Lambda.

4. **Near Real-Time Log Analytics:** Developing a real-time log analytics system using AWS Kinesis, Amazon EMR, and Amazon Athena for immediate data insights.

5. **Data Warehousing and Visualization:** Creating a data warehousing solution using AWS Redshift and data visualization using AWS QuickSight for in-depth analysis and reporting.

## AWS Services Used

The Cadabra Big Data System Project leverages a range of AWS services to achieve its objectives. These services include, but are not limited to:

- AWS Kinesis: For real-time data streaming and analytics.
- AWS EC2: To host applications and services.
- AWS S3: For secure and scalable data storage.
- AWS Lambda: For serverless computing and event-driven data processing.
- AWS DynamoDB: For NoSQL database management.
- AWS QuickSight: For interactive data visualization and business intelligence.
- Amazon EMR: For processing large-scale data using Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.
- Amazon Athena: For serverless query and analysis of data in S3.
- AWS Redshift: For data warehousing and analytics.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into five main folders, each representing one part of the project implementation:

1. `01_order_history_functionality`: Contains the code and configurations for the order history functionality.
2. `02_product_recommendations`: Includes the implementation of the product recommendation system.
3. `03_transaction_rate_alarm`: Contains code for setting up the transaction rate alarm system.
4. `04_near_real_time_log_analytics`: Houses the code for building the real-time log analytics architecture.
5. `05_data_warehousing_and_visualization`: Includes the implementation of data warehousing and visualization components.

Each folder contains detailed instructions, code samples, and configuration files required to deploy and run the specific part of the project.
