# Cadabra Big Data System Project

Welcome to the Cadabra big data system project! This repository contains a collection of AWS cloud documentation that showcase the comprehensive implementations for Cadabra. Cadabra is the name we'll use for our mock e-commerce clothing store. These architectures has been carefully designed and built as part of my preparation for the AWS Certified Data Analytics Specialty Examination, following the excellent guidance provided by Stephan Maarek's preparation course on Udemy.

## Project Overview

The Cadabra Big Data System Project consists of a five-part implementation, each focusing on crucial aspects of Cadabra's Architecture. The primary objectives of these implementations are as follows:

1. **Order History Functionality:** Implementing data pipelines to capture and analyze order history data using AWS Kinesis, Lambda, and DynamoDB.

2. **Product Recommendations:** Building recommendation systems using AWS Kinesis and S3 to collect data and use AWS Elastic Map Reduce to provide personalized product recommendations based on user behavior.

3. **Transaction Rate Alarm:** Setting up alarms and notifications for detecting unusual transaction rates using AWS Kinesis, Lambda, and SNS.

4. **Near Real-Time Log Analytics:** Developing a real-time log analytics system using AWS Kinesis, and Amazon OpenSearch for immediate data insights.

5. **Data Warehousing and Visualization:** Creating a data warehousing solution using AWS Redshift and S3, and use AWS Glue, Athena, and QuickSight for data visualization, in-depth analysis and reporting.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into five main folders, each representing one part of the project implementation:

1. `01_order_history_functionality`: Contains the code and configurations for the order history functionality.
2. `02_product_recommendations`: Includes the implementation of the product recommendation system.
3. `03_transaction_rate_alarm`: Contains code for setting up the transaction rate alarm system.
4. `04_near_real_time_log_analytics`: Houses the code for building the real-time log analytics architecture.
5. `05_data_warehousing_and_visualization`: Includes the implementation of data warehousing and visualization components.

Each folder contains detailed instructions, code samples, and configuration files required to deploy and run the specific part of the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Cadabra Big Data System Project, follow the steps outlined below:

1. Navigate to the relevant folder for the component you wish to explore.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the README.md file of each folder to deploy and test the implementation.


## Acknowledgments

I would like to express gratitude to Stephan Maarek for his exceptional guidance and insights provided in the Udemy course, which served as the foundation for this project.
