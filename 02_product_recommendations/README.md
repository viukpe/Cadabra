# Product Recommendations

![ScreenShot](/assets/images/02.png)

This project aims to build a recommendation system using AWS Kinesis Analytics, Lambda, and EMR to provide personalized product recommendations based on user behaviour. The solution leverages machine learning models to offer users relevant product suggestions, enhancing their shopping experience.

## Steps in the Implementation

### 1. Data Ingestion with Kinesis
Steps have been previously implemented in the `01_order_history_functionality` folder.

We're simply connecting our Kinesis data stream to the Kinesis Firehose delivery stream.

### 2. Data Storage with S3

AWS allows us to store our data in S3 from Kinesis easily. When configuring our Kinesis data stream, we can set what bucket we want our data stored in; here, we can configure our files to be held in partitions - day, month, and year.


### 3. Recommendation Model with EMR

AWS Elastic Map Reduce is a powerful tool for running high-level distributed machine learning models. Here, we'll set up Hadoop clusters to manage data processing and model our stored data to produce a simple recommendations model using the OLS method for prediction. The following steps are involved:
- Cluster setup
- Data loading
- Installing libraries 
- Data processing and modelling
- Model Training and validation
- Generate recommendations

**Note:** I did not build the model. I'm only using them to practice creating a recommendations infrastructure.

## Further Steps

- The personalized product recommendations generated by EMR can be stored in a database or cache for quick access. Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon Aurora for persistent storage or Amazon ElastiCache for caching recommendations. The recommendations can then be delivered to the user interface, enabling real-time display on the e-commerce platform.


## Prerequisites

Before setting up and running this implementation, ensure that you have:

- AWS account credentials with appropriate permissions to create and manage Kinesis data streams, EMR, Lambda functions, and databases.

- Knowledge of python for machine learning modelling and big data processing framework - Apache Spark.
