# Product Recommendations

![ScreenShot](/assets/images/02.png)

This project aims to build recommendation systems using AWS Kinesis Analytics and AWS Lambda to provide personalized product recommendations based on user behavior. The solution leverages real-time data analytics to offer users relevant product suggestions, enhancing their shopping experience.

## Steps in the Implementation

### 1. Data Ingestion with Kinesis
Steps have been previously implemented in the `01_order_history_functionality` folder.

We're simply connecting our Kinesis data stream to the Kinesis Firehose delivery stream.

### 2. Data Storage with S3

AWS allows us to easily store our data in S3 from Kinesis. When configuring our Kinesis data stream we can set what bucket we want our data stored in, here we can configure our files to be stored in partitions - day, month, and year.


### 3. Recommendation Model with EMR

AWS Elastic Map Reduce a powerful tool used for running high-level distributed machine learning models. Here, we'll set up hadoop clusters to manage data processing and modelling of our stored data. The following steps are involved:
- Cluster setup
- Data loading
- Installing libraries 
- Data processing and modelling
- Model Training and validation
- Generate recommendations

**Note:** The models were not built by me, i'm only using them to practice building a recommendations infrastructure.

## Further Steps

### 1. Storage and Delivery of Recommendations

The personalized product recommendations generated by EMR can be stored in a database or cache for quick access. You can use Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon Aurora for persistent storage or Amazon ElastiCache for caching recommendations. The recommendations can then be delivered to the user interface, enabling real-time display on the e-commerce platform.


## Prerequisites

Before setting up and running this implementation, ensure that you have:

- AWS account credentials with appropriate permissions to create and manage Kinesis data streams, Kinesis Analytics applications, Lambda functions, and databases.

- Knowledge of SQL queries to perform data analysis with Kinesis Analytics.
