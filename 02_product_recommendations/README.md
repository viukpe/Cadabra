# Product Recommendations - AWS Implementation

![ScreenShot](/assets/images/02.png)

This project aims to build recommendation systems using AWS Kinesis Analytics and AWS Lambda to provide personalized product recommendations based on user behavior. The solution leverages real-time data analytics to offer users relevant product suggestions, enhancing their shopping experience.

## Steps in the Implementation

### 1. Data Collection with Kinesis

Amazon Kinesis is used to collect and process real-time streaming data, capturing user behavior such as clicks, views, and purchases on the e-commerce platform. Kinesis Data Streams enable the ingestion of large volumes of data with low latency, ensuring immediate availability for analysis.

### 2. Real-time Data Analysis with Kinesis Analytics

AWS Kinesis Analytics is employed to perform real-time data analysis on the incoming data stream. You can create SQL queries using Kinesis Analytics to extract meaningful insights from the user behavior data. These queries process the data in real-time, allowing for continuous and dynamic updates to the recommendation system.

### 3. Recommendation Model with Lambda

AWS Lambda functions are utilized to implement the recommendation model based on the data analysis results from Kinesis Analytics. The Lambda functions take the user behavior data and apply machine learning algorithms to generate personalized product recommendations for each user.

### 4. Storage and Delivery of Recommendations

The personalized product recommendations generated by Lambda functions can be stored in a database or cache for quick access. You can use Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon Aurora for persistent storage or Amazon ElastiCache for caching recommendations. The recommendations can then be delivered to the user interface, enabling real-time display on the e-commerce platform.


## Prerequisites

Before setting up and running this implementation, ensure that you have:

- AWS account credentials with appropriate permissions to create and manage Kinesis data streams, Kinesis Analytics applications, Lambda functions, and databases.

- Knowledge of SQL queries to perform data analysis with Kinesis Analytics.
